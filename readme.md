# The GoonLight Heist.

## What the hell is this?

This is a lighting engine for the BYOND game engine, it is licensed under the MIT license.

Credits to @Mloc (code), @PJB3005 (code), @mwerezak (really small amount of code), Tobba (who I stole the way it works from), and Marquesas (for fixing the spelling of the word 'license', twice).
